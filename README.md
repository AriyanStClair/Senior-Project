CCNY Spring 2019 Senior Capstone Project

This project is the culmination of a Senior Capstone project. This project was a collaborative effort between myself and two peers. The topic of the project is Music Genre Classification using the GTZAN dataset. Utilizing various machine learning techniques, a song's genre can be classified into one of the following genres: pop,rock,metal,country,blues,jazz,classical,reggae,disco, and hiphop.
